= Supplying source or target values that are missing

When you map fields, you might find that a source data shape does not provide a value that a target data shape requires, or vice versa. You can choose to supply values that are missing by either defining a property or a constant. 

For example, suppose that a target data shape defines a *Layout* field whose value must be HORIZONTAL or VERTICAL. The source data shape does not provide this field. You can create a constant and then map it to the *Layout* target field.

.Prerequisite

* In the data mapper, the *Mapping Details* panel is open.

.Procedure

To define a constant:

. At the top of the *Source* or *Target* panel, to the right of *Constants*, click *Add* (+).
+
The *Create Constant* dialog opens.
. Type the value of the constant.
. Select a data type. 
. Click *Save* to create a new field.

To define a property:

. At the top of the *Source* or *Target* panel, to the right of *Properties*, click *Add* (+).
+
The *Create Property* dialog opens.
. Type the property name.
+
Note that at runtime, if there is an environment variable or a Java system property with the same name as the property, it is possible for this default value to be overridden. 

. Type the propertyâ€™s default value.
. Select a data type. 
. From the *Scope* pull-down menu, select one of the options to define the scope of the property:
* *Current message header* - The message header passed into the Data Mapper step from the previous step.
* *Camel Exchange Property* - For Camel-specific properties.
* *Result*  - A message header from any previous step.
